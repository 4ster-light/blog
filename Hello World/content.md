## Hi

If you are reading this you probably already know who I am, a teenage software
developer from Spain, my name is David, but most know me as Aster :D.

### The spark

Let's take this from the beginning, so you know where I'm coming from. I began
to be, at least, curious about coding when I was just a kid (at the moment I'm
writing this I'm 17 years old), because my father decided to study his second
university degree, Computer Engineering, and was handed an assignment to make
`Space Invaders` in Java, and tested the game he made with me.

### First try

After that, several years passed, until I was already in my first year of high
school at 12 years old, when for some reason I can't even remember I wanted to
give this craft a try. Of course as you may imagine by that previous experience,
I asked if he could teach me since I didn't know where should I start or what to
do jajaja. He opened his Eclipse IDE in Windows 7 Pro and there I went, I only
lasted two weeks of course, I was a kid trying to understand what a function was
in a language where _"Hello World"_ spans dozens of characters, but anyway let's
take another leap forward.

### Ok, now this time for real

Now you find me at 15 years old, that being two years ago at the moment
(December 2024 right now) might feel like yesterday to most but I'm a teen,
that's like 11% of my life (which if you think about it is a lot). I started
playing with Python as everyone that starts coding after 2010 usually does, had
my VSCode running on Windows 10 without activation key, and was simply ready to
go, This time I took two months before I was bored of `Flask` and `Jinja`, but
without that I don't think I would be writing this today to tell you jejeje.

This is one of the reasons why Python holds a special place in my heart, as I'd
think it does for most the first language they ever learnt and actually enjoyed,
or even if you didn't really enjoy it you'll still get those memories and get
that feeling "how far I've come haven't I?".

### Hell yeah, now we are talking

And now the big moment, what we were all waiting for, July 2024, I just turned
17 years old, I came across some of my old toy websites in that directory you
forget about in your old pendrive, and I was like, "damn, maybe I should try
this", because I'm that kind of person that (used) to waste their summer without
actually doing anything productive. I went all in, I was extremely motivated,
watched some YouTube tutorials, and created my now, if I dare say it, quite
decent sized Twitter account [@4ster_light](https://x.com/4ster_light), where I
share everything about my projects and learning by the way. As much as I
sometimes get frustrated with that app, it's the core of my journey as a
developer and I owe so much to it, it and all the people there that support me
keep me doing what I do and I love it more each day.

A quick summary is that I love programming languages and the web, I like to try
languages as a hobby, getting to know them and expanding my knowledge about any
programming style or paradigm that exists and can improve my current skills,
this opinion is always changing but I'm going to leave it here so you or me can
come back look at it and laugh for a moment: The languages I enjoy to write the
most and the ones I currently see myself using in the future are: Typescript,
C#/F#, and Rust.

Probably my GitHub gives a better view of my stuff either now or whenever you
are reading this so, have a look and enjoy!

Just as a bonus, you also might be wondering about the λ on my socials, which
basically represents lambda calculus, a mathematical theory that is used to
describe functions, and is a very important concept in computer science.

## See you around :D

So, yeah, that's pretty much my story and who I am, I may have changed in the
future, as I've mentioned several times I'm writing this at 17 years old. My
writing skills nor storytelling capabilities may not be the best, but I'm sure
I'll get better jajaja, I hope you enjoy all of my content and/or apps, so, as
always, thanks for reading!
